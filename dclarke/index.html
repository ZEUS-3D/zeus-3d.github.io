      <h5 class="clear">About me</h5>

      <p>Born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island to Sheila (née Davison; Charlottetown) and Alan Clarke (Halifax) in 1958, I was raised in Ontario and did my B.Sc. at <a href="http://www.queensu.ca/" class="style09" target="_blank"> Queen's University</a> at Kingston (Honours Physics, 1981).  My M.Sc. (Thesis: "Two-Dimensional Collapse of a Rotating Interstellar Cloud", 1984) was also from Queen's under Dick Henriksen.  My Ph.D. (Dissertation: "A Search for the Effects of Active Magnetic Fields in Extragalactic Radio Sources", 1988) was from the <a href="http://www.unm.edu/" class="style09" target="_blank">University of New Mexico</a> under Jack Burns and Mike Norman (LANL, NCSA).</p>

      <p>I was a post-doctoral fellow at the <a href="http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/" class="style09" target="_blank">NCSA</a> (U. Illinois) from 1988–1992 under Mike Norman, and a post-doctoral research associate at the <a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/" class="style09" target="_blank">Harvard-Smithsonian CfA</a> from 1992–1993 under Ramesh Narayan.</p>

      <p>In 1993, I was appointed an assistant professor at Saint Mary's University, promoted to associate professor in 1995, gained tenure in 1996, and promoted again to full professor in 2003.  During my 2000–2001 sabbatical leave, I was appointed astronome invité at <a href="http://www-laog.obs.ujf-grenoble.fr/" class="style09" target="_blank">l'observatoire de Grenoble</a>.  You can view my CV <a href="../inc/documents/vitabrief.pdf" class="style09" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <h5 class="clear">About my family</h5>

      <p>I went to the U.S. in 1984 single, came home in 1993 with a family.  My wife of 34 years (as of Oct. 2021), <a href="http://www.terc.edu/staff/211.html" class="style09" target="_blank">Jodi Asbell-Clarke</a>, hails from North Haven, CT and is currently a senior science curriculum developer at a non-profit in Cambridge MA.  My son, Dane, born in Albuquerque NM in 1989, received his BIT from Carleton/Algonquin in 2011 and is a graphic artist <a href="https://lifeasplay.ca/" class="style09" target="_blank">(check out his webpage!)</a> while my daughter, Alison, born in Urbana IL in 1992, completed her political science degree from the University of Guelph in 2014.  Both live in Halifax.</p>

      <p>Both of my parents have passed.  I have two brothers; Peter Clarke lives in the Toronto area with his wife Mayr, and Gordon Macdonald lives on Vancouver Island with his wife Nicky. My step-mother, Adaline O'Gorman, lives in Victoria.</p>
